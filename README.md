# PROJECT BS2

## Study of graphs of interactions

**UE BS2**

*Enora CORLER and LÃ©a BEAULIEU - M2 BIS*


This project is dedicated to the study of graphs of interactions between proteins, by writting tools to manipulate these graphs, and to introduce into these graphs a notion of interaction between protein domains.

Scripts :
* **TP.PY** : python file containing the main functions
* **test.py** : python file containing the main functions

Additional files : 
* **semaine_12.pdf** : PDF file of the TP
* **Human_HighQuality.txt** : a test file containing interactions (more complex : 27276 interactions)
* **toy_example.txt** : a test file containing interactions (more simple : only 6 interactions)
* **false_file_example-1.txt** to **false_file_example-4.txt** : files based on the *toy_example.txt* file which are not correctly written (empty file, wrong numbers of line/interactions/columns)
* **toy_example_to_clean.txt** : example file with homo-dimers and repetitions which is used in input to generate a cleaned file in output
* **interaction_graph.png** : schematic figure based on the interactions of the *toy_example.txt* file
